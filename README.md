- You will also need [Python 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the Raspberry Pi in order to get the temperature-monitoring going. You can see more about that over at the [python branch](https://github.com/mortea15/BrewSource/tree/python)
- After you've cloned the repository, checkout to the sails branch by typing
``
git checkout sails
``
- Now, while in the terminal, navigate to your local clone (folder) and type
``
npm install
``
- **Finally, run sails lift in the command line**
